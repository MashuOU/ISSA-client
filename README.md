Based on our youngest member Lintang Macnesa and his first hand experience as a newly graduate, this issue arises from the school environment, where parents often lack direct connections to the school and access to information about their child's academic progress, such as test scores or attendance. This application is designed to provide parents with access to monitor their child's academic and non-academic development anytime, anywhere, without the need to wait for exam results that typically come out only every six months. By establishing a connection between the school and parents to supervise their child's development, this application is expected to increase parents' sense of care for their children, in collaboration with teachers, to achieve the best possible results during their children's time in school.

ISSA is divided into 2 main services : Content Management System (CMS) for teachers and Webservice for students and parents.

CMS Services:
 - Assign each subject test score for each student along side with teacher's note or feedback
 - Classroom administration such as students attendance, 'CRUD' Students (add new student or edit student information), 'CRUD' subject (Chemistry, Math, Social Science, etc)
 - Real-Time chat or counseling with students or parents
*CRUD stands for Create Read Update Delete

Web Services :
 - Real-time Students today attendance status
 - All School activity for a month (Test, School events, Subject Schedule, etc)
 - School fee Payment via payment gateway
 - Test Score for each subject and teacher's note
 - Real-Time chat or counseling with Homeroom Teacher

ISSA is currently on it's early stage and development but we do believe that it'll become a life changing future of educational sector with further enhancement and support
